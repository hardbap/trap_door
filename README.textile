h1. Trap Door - Reverse Captcha for Rails

Unobtrusive Captcha for your Rails forms. Trap Door works by adding a hidden "honeypot" field to your forms that only a spam bot will fill out. A before filter checks for the presence of this field and banishes bots to a "spam trap":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mike_Rosoft/Spambot.

h2. Installation

@script/plugin install git://github.com/hardbap/trap_door.git@

h2. Using Trap Door

h3. In your view

<pre><code>
    <% form_for(@post) do |form| %>
        <%= trap_door_field %>
        
        # the rest of your form...
</code></pre>

h3. In your controller

<pre><code>
    class PostsController < ApplicationController
        trap_door :only => :create
        
        # the rest of your controller...
</code></pre>

h2. Configuration

By default Trap Door names the hidden_field @:affiliate_id@. Obviously this won't work for everyone so you can change the field name by creating an initializer in @config/initializers@ and telling Trap Door the name it should use for the honeypot field:

@TrapDoor.honeypot_field_name = :go_away@
